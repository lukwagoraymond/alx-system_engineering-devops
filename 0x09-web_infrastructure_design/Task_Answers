Task (0)
You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:
What is a server
What is the role of the domain name
What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com

What is the role of the web server
Web Servers enable HTTP access to a 'Web Site' which is simply a collection of documents and other information organised into a tree structure, much like a computer's tree structure.  

What is the role of the application server
What is the role of the database
What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website
You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:
SPOF
Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted)
Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic

Task (1)
You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:
For every additional element, why you are adding it
What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works
Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both
How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works
What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application
You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:
Where are SPOF
Security issues (no firewall, no HTTPS)
No monitoring

Task (2)
For every additional element, why you are adding it

SSL (https)
Note that information (like usernames and passwords) exchanged over the internet through browsers is encoded but not encrypted. Encrytion means a secure form of encoding, wherein the content can only be decoded if a unique key value is known. Simple HTTP encoding mechanisms like the Base64 used for authenitification can be decoded by anyone who knows the encoding scheme. The encoded messages under https are transimitted over a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) connection i.e., the messages are encrypted before transmission and decrypted after being received by the server. The SSL protocol determines how the server and the browser negotiate what encryption algorithm to use.

What are firewalls for?
Is a specialised gatway that screens network traffic
Why is the traffic served over HTTPS
What monitoring is used for
How the monitoring tool is collecting data
Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS

You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:
Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue
Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue
Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem

Task (3) 
You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:
