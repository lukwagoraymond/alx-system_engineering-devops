## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

* What it is
* How many layers it has
* How it is organized

---

### [0. OSI model](./0-OSI_model)
* OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is an abstract model to describe layered communication and computer network design. The idea is to segregate the different parts of what make communication possible.


### [1. Types of network](./1-types_of_network)
* 


### [2. MAC and IP address](./2-MAC_and_IP_address)
* 


### [3. UDP and TCP](./3-UDP_and_TCP)
* 


### [4. TCP and UDP ports](./4-TCP_and_UDP_ports)
* Once packets have been sent to the right network device using IP using either UDP or TCP as a mode of transportation, it needs to actually enter the network device.


### [5. Is the host on the network](./5-is_the_host_on_the_network)
*
